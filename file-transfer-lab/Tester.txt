In the film we see great amounts of violence being preformed towards the 
citizens. During peaceful protest we saw the military police and security 
forces beat protesters and then begin shooting into the crowd to get hem to 
disperse. Killing women and children as they try to get the crowd to leave 
only made them gather in other areas of Syria. Any individual who voiced 
their opinions on the regime was seen as an enemy I could suffer the 
consequences. Torture was very common tactic used on people withholding 
information or as a way to be made an example of. All these fear inducing 
tactics are what caused the people of Syria to start a revolution that hey 
hope will result in change in their government to a democracy.
